I\u2019d just stepped through a large puddle when I noticed what appeared to be dandelion seeds floating toward me on the breeze. However, there was no breeze, and there are no dandelions deep within this Nature Reserve. Could milkweed seeds have made there way up from the valleys below?

I held up my hand in the vicinity of one of these tiny floating *feathers* and as it landed I could see wings and legs. It appeared almost fairy-like with beautiful translucent purple wings and a tuft of vivid white hair extending from its abdomen. A waxy resin was along the sides of its abdomen, which I mistook for modified gills thinking it had just emerged from a nymph stage in the water. \n\nSome landed on trees and some on the ground and they disappeared as quickly and quietly as they had arrived.

The best I could do was \"insect\", but I had absolutely no idea what family or even order they belonged to. \n\nThankfully Twitter came to the rescue and QuestaGame confirmed. It turned out to be a male giant mealy bug *Callipappus* sp. (often referred to as a bird-of-paradise fly).

Two adult whales approached our boat and started mugging us, a behaviour where the whales circle the boat (no loss of money). All we could do was turn our boat engine off and enjoy.

It was Squawky and his Missus, protesting that the cockatoo was eating their seeds. I took photos of the duo standing over the cockatoo....well at least trying to! Eventually the poor cockatoo gave in and let the squawking pair feast on the seeds. What a mess I had to clean up! The left-over seed was put into a plastic container. So I thought that was the end of that! However, the cockatoo was too clever. I would hide the seed but he kept finding it. Then the lorikeets would want their share.

On a one night stop over in Greymouth on the west coast of the South Island, we stayed at an Air BnB. The hosts suggested we visit a local tramping route, \u201cWoods Creek Track\u201d, that traversed through a historic gold mine site. The track itself was more beautiful than we expected with lush vegetation, tunnels to explore and a harmonious balance between the historic gold mine relics and the mossy re-growth. The highlight of this walk, however, was the friendship that formed between us and a local. This local Greymouth resident wore a soft, grey coat, stood tall with confidence and rocked his feet to the beat of the bush. He was in fact a South Island Robin, and would have to have been one of the friendliest birds I have ever met. He followed us along most the walk, hopping on the ground and flitting between nearby trees. His behaviour reminded me of the Blue Mountains local, Eastern Yellow Robin, but he was even friendlier. One of the more curious behaviours we observed was when the South Island Robin would place one foot out in front of himself, hover it above the ground, and then very quickly tremble his foot up and down. My partner and I guessed that he may be dislodging bugs from the ground beneath. When we caught onto his hungry intention, we would brush the ground to show the soil beneath and then step back. The curious Robin would hop onto the spot we had just brushed, stomp his foot excitedly and peck at grubs as they arose. This continued for some time until we reached the end of the walk. I have never had such a close interaction with a bird before, which made this walk a truly unforgettable experience.

This year was a little different and in fact I spent most of the long weekend inside eating my feelings. Thankfully, I was pulled from my couch for an all-day adventure! An 8 hour kayak adventure was ahead and little did I know what I was in for. Huge swell, sea sickness, sunburn and exhaustion. Oh, and time to appreciate the most amazing bird and marine life that Sydney Harbour surrounds have to offer. The great thing about a kayak, apart from it being a social distancing appropriate activity, is accessibility to remote locations and the ability to activate \u2018stealth mode\u2019. On this day, these characteristics offered lowly kayakers the most Oar-inspiring Osprey encounter. In very close proximity, an Osprey had just caught a big fish and perched for lunch.  We sat, floating silently, for more than 10 minutes watching it devour the live fish, head first, totally unfussed by us. It was one of those surreal moments of complete stillness, thinking about the life of an Osprey, and surrendering to the draws of nature in the middle of a huge city.  It completely made my day!

They are unmissable, a bright orange flash poking around every nook and cranny in search of their unfortunate prey. Seeing a spider wasp, members of the family Pompilidae, dragging a paralysed Huntsman spider back to a convenient hole or burrow is a common sight and one that captures the beauty and brutality of nature in one convenient image.\n \nThe biology behind these interactions is pretty straightforward. The wasp paralyses the spider, typically lays a single egg on the spider, buries it, and leaves its larvae to feed on the undead host.\n \nIt\u2019s worth taking the time to watch the trials and tribulations surrounding these interactions when you stumble upon them. This pompilid (spider wasp) I observed spent 30 minutes trying to get her paralysed victim into a convenient spot outside my home. After an admirably tenacious effort to lift the spider into a vent at the side of the house, she threw in the towel. In their inimitable way, ants then went to town on the unfortunate arachnid, dismembering it in short term. As with many ecological interactions in the city, ants came out as the winners.

Her shelter has a simple beauty; it is her material paradise where, wingless, I think of her as living her entire life bound within her enclosure of contented memories and dreams. In this time of Covid-19 when we, like the case moth, must also be home-bodies, home is where the heart has to be. An afternoon with the case moth has taught me that home is more than a mere shelter.

It\u2019s a native swamp rat. It\u2019s wary of me but it doesn\u2019t seem scared; there\u2019s bigger fish to fry.

The rat scurries by my feet, reaches up on its hind legs, chomps off the stem, and hurries to safety. Never mind that I am only a metre away, or that there\u2019s a crowd of people nearby.
