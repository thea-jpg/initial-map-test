They are easily recognisable by a distinctive red-black symmetrical pattern on their back.\n\nMy first encounter with a firebug was in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone whilst conducting multispecies ethnographic research. A biologist picked up a firebug and pointed to its asymmetrical back pattern as evidence of the effects of radiation on Chernobyl\u2019s wildlife (Figure 1).\n\n(image: jonathon-turnbull-mutant-firebugs-1.jpg imgclass: clickable)\n\nSeeing the effects of radiation made visible\u2014via an apparently materially palpable mutation \u2014satisfied tropes of the \u2018mutant\u2019 I\u2019d become accustomed to from sci-fi nuclear narratives(i).

Each time I see one, I bend down to take a closer look, inspecting the pattern on its back to compare it to the one I saw at Chernobyl.\n\nInterestingly, I\u2019m yet to see an asymmetrical pattern on a firebug outside Chernobyl (Figure 2).

I was learning to be affected by them as Bruno Latour would say.\n\nEncounters like this shape how we come to know the often-unnoticed critters we share our cities with, as well as the effects of human activities on neighbouring nonhuman bodies.

On a one night stop over in Greymouth on the west coast of the South Island, we stayed at an Air BnB. The hosts suggested we visit a local tramping route, \u201cWoods Creek Track\u201d, that traversed through a historic gold mine site. The track itself was more beautiful than we expected with lush vegetation, tunnels to explore and a harmonious balance between the historic gold mine relics and the mossy re-growth. The highlight of this walk, however, was the friendship that formed between us and a local. This local Greymouth resident wore a soft, grey coat, stood tall with confidence and rocked his feet to the beat of the bush. He was in fact a South Island Robin, and would have to have been one of the friendliest birds I have ever met. He followed us along most the walk, hopping on the ground and flitting between nearby trees. His behaviour reminded me of the Blue Mountains local, Eastern Yellow Robin, but he was even friendlier. One of the more curious behaviours we observed was when the South Island Robin would place one foot out in front of himself, hover it above the ground, and then very quickly tremble his foot up and down. My partner and I guessed that he may be dislodging bugs from the ground beneath. When we caught onto his hungry intention, we would brush the ground to show the soil beneath and then step back. The curious Robin would hop onto the spot we had just brushed, stomp his foot excitedly and peck at grubs as they arose. This continued for some time until we reached the end of the walk. I have never had such a close interaction with a bird before, which made this walk a truly unforgettable experience. In response, I created an artwork from a photo I took of the bird during the walk and was able to exhibit the artwork, \u201cA Friend from Greymouth (South Island Robin)\u201d in my 2018 Solo Exhibition at MContemporary in Sydney.","date":"2020-05-06","tags":"bird","genres":"","location":"Greymouth, New Zealand","excerpt":"I have never had such a close interaction with a bird before, which made this walk a truly unforgettable experience.","coverImage":"- potter.jpg","storyAuthor":"Meaghan Potter","authorBio":"Australian artist and teacher, Meaghan Potter draws from the nature of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury where she lives."},"id":"5f264df76447b"},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[{"value":null},{"value":null}]},"properties":{"url":"http:\/\/urbanfieldnaturalist.org\/stories\/oar-some-osprey","name":"Oar-some Osprey","storyFullText":"Easter for me is steeped in tradition of spending time in the Aussie bush.

On this day, these characteristics offered lowly kayakers the most Oar-inspiring Osprey encounter. In very close proximity, an Osprey had just caught a big fish and perched for lunch.  We sat, floating silently, for more than 10 minutes watching it devour the live fish, head first, totally unfussed by us.

They are unmissable, a bright orange flash poking around every nook and cranny in search of their unfortunate prey. Seeing a spider wasp, members of the family Pompilidae, dragging a paralysed Huntsman spider back to a convenient hole or burrow is a common sight and one that captures the beauty and brutality of nature in one convenient image.\n \nThe biology behind these interactions is pretty straightforward. The wasp paralyses the spider, typically lays a single egg on the spider, buries it, and leaves its larvae to feed on the undead host.\n \nIt\u2019s worth taking the time to watch the trials and tribulations surrounding these interactions when you stumble upon them. This pompilid (spider wasp) I observed spent 30 minutes trying to get her paralysed victim into a convenient spot outside my home. After an admirably tenacious effort to lift the spider into a vent at the side of the house, she threw in the towel. In their inimitable way, ants then went to town on the unfortunate arachnid, dismembering it in short term. As with many ecological interactions in the city, ants came out as the winners.
