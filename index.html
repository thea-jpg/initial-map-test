But many residents of Sandringham in Melbourne’s south east seem to have been unaware of the presence of these magnificent birds. \n\nWe were on a neighbourhood walk when we saw tell-tale signs: big pieces of pine cone, freshly chewed, strewn about the footpath. A quick scan up and around, and there they were in the tops of a few tall trees. One landed briefly on a front fence, another on a carport roof, before flying back up to the anonymity of the treetops. After a few minutes, by tacit agreement, they flew off out of sight.\n\nMore Melburnians are reporting sightings of yellow-tailed black-cockatoos in the suburbs this autumn; some have asked me if their presence is a consequence of last summer’s vast bushfires in south-eastern Australia. I think it’s more likely they’ve been quietly visiting the suburbs to feast on pine cones and other treats for many years, but are being noticed - often for the first time - by people with more time to spend in their gardens, to walk in local streets, and to pause in parks and reserves... thanks to Covid-19.",

				 "storyFullText": "Autumn and winter are one of my favourite times of the year. The weather is getting cooler and the change of season marks the annual arrival of one of the world’s biggest animals, humpback whales. Each year, these ocean giants the size of a school bus appear in our Sydney marine backyard. They travel northward along the humpback whale highway, which hugs the east coast on course to their warmer water breeding/calving grounds of the Great Barrier Reef. They have spent the summer in Antarctica where they annually feed on Antarctica Krill, tiny crustaceans around 1-2cm long. \n\nI have been whale watching off Sydney for nearly 10 years and feel privileged to have these animals in our backyard. This means a lot to me as a former Canberran, having grown up on a farm three hours away from the closest beach. I’ve also worked around humpback whales as a naturalist and spent years studying them on Sydney cliffs and offshore for my PhD.\n\nI recall an amazing interaction I had with two whales one October during the southward migration. It was as if myself and the team were the most interesting things they had ever seen. Two adult whales approached our boat and started mugging us, a behaviour where the whales circle the boat (no loss of money). All we could do was turn our boat engine off and enjoy. They spent hours rolling around and spy hopping, a behaviour where a whale brings its mouth and eye out of the water. It was such a magnificent interaction, which allowed me to snap some fantastic photos. A truly memorable moment and one I hope to have again off Sydney.",

Here’s the problem, birds largely belong to the telephoto world, a world of distance and open spaces. Currently, my world has contracted, from the National Park to the urban park to the backyard. From telephoto to macro.\n\nThe macro world is the small world, the world of close up and tiny creatures. Paradoxically there is a huge amount to see in this small world. A single tree trunk can support great numbers of minibeasts as I’ve discovered on my daily exercise walk around the block accompanied by a husband, aged dog and macro camera lens. \n\nA different kind of bird caught my interest too, a Ladybird! On the walk there is a Chinese Elm (*Ulmus parvifolia*), a street tree with lovely bark that is the home to many creatures including at least three species of Ladybird beetles, one of which, the Tortoise-shelled Ladybird (*Harmonia testudinaria*), seems to live out a good part of its one to two months of life right there. Like all beetles or Coleoptera, ladybirds undergo four stages of life - egg, larva, pupa and adult. Over the period of Covid-19 lockdown, these stages have played out before me as the daily exercise takes me past this ecosystem on a tree trunk.  \n\nThe below photos show:\n1.\tEggs\n2.\tHatching, larva or instar will go through four moults\n3.\tPupa\n4.\tNewly emerged adult or imago\n5.\tAdult ready to fly",

She is a female Owl Limpet (*Lottia gigantea*), with ridges and barnacles texturing the top of her conical, chicken-egg-sized shell. \n\nAs I rub my inquisitive fingers along her serrated upper surface, I notice a green hue and slimy texture—a layer of algae, I deduce—growing upon the surrounding rock. The algal layer is arranged in a striking patchwork pattern, as if a miniature lawn mower had been haphazardly dragged across an overgrown, slippery lawn.  \n\nA consultation with my intertidal field guide unveils the unique mutualism that created the mysterious texture: The female limpet is an algae gardener. She defends her home territory and maintains a lawn of verdant algae, which she grazes systematically to allow for regrowth and regular harvest. To care for her garden, she secretes a protein and carbohydrate-rich mucus that traps bacteria and serves as a fertilizer for her photosynthetic companions. With careful tending and aggressive territorial defense—in which she “bulldozes” other intertidal critters out of her zone—a limpet can occupy a patch of earth in partnership with her symbiotic allies for up to several years. \n\nIn this time of global unraveling, many of us have turned our attentions towards the living spaces (and gardens, for those of us lucky enough to have access to outdoor space) that we occupy. Perhaps Owl Limpets and their symbiotic algae can offer us lessons of care and interdependence, which we might carry into our relationships with the other-than-human companions that we share our living spaces with.",

A lyrebird.” \n“You’re kidding?”\n“Nope.” \n\nA lyrebird in the greenhouse is pretty exciting but in truth I wished it was Betty, our resident eastern blue-tongue lizard (*Tiliqua scincoides*) and strawberry thief extraordinaire, whom we feared had not survived the searing hot summer. We’d known Betty for about five years but it had taken us most of this time to figure out (a) why we’d hardly had a single strawberry, despite the entire 20 square metre patch being fully enclosed in mesh; (b) why the slug and snail populations had crashed and (c) how this connected to the ever-fattening blue tongue in the greenhouse (in our naivety, we assumed she was permanently pregnant). \n\nBetty had evidently spent many a winter’s night playing *Escape From Colditz* because the clever girl had excavated a passageway from the greenhouse to the strawberry fields. (We moved the strawberry plants elsewhere.) After another winter, as spring approached and the proverbial sap rose, Betty acceded to the overtures of a dark and handsome lad. I wish I’d been forewarned what a robust and vicious affair this is. Her suitor grabbed her by the scruff of the neck and shook her like a rag doll. She bears deep scarring from previous matings and I had to summon all my willpower not to intervene. What a brute! \n\nAutumn arrived and baby blue-tongues popped up all over the garden. Who knows how many she delivered – perhaps as many as 20 – but the kookaburras and some cold snaps have taken a few, I suspect. Sharing a one-acre, suburban-bushland block in the Blue Mountains, these blue-tongues are infinitely more likely to live to their full life span of perhaps 30 years than their Sydney cousins, who are being killed off fast by cars, cats, dogs and clearing.* As we snuggle down into winter, Betty’s back in the greenhouse, cosy under the earth and mulch, with one rapidly growing boy we’ve called Prince to keep her company. \n\n\n* Koenig, J., Shine, R., & Shea, G.

I soon realised that a regular pair of visiting Rainbow Lorikeets (Squawky and his Missus) had also discovered the feast. Not good for them! Then a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo also discovered the seed bell. I suspect the lorikeets and cockatoo chased the King-Parrots away. I decided to put the seed bell out after the lorikeets had left my garden for the cockatoo. The seed bell soon got eaten, but all I could get was loose seed. I left the packet on the table, ready for filling the feeder the next time the cockatoo visited.\n\nBUT the next morning, I got woken early by the shrieks from the cockatoo. I found him tearing a hole in the packet of seeds. Soon it was big enough to start his feast, looking very pleased with himself! Just dozing off when a new ruckus began, far louder than before! It was Squawky and his Missus, protesting that the cockatoo was eating their seeds. I took photos of the duo standing over the cockatoo....well at least trying to! Eventually the poor cockatoo gave in and let the squawking pair feast on the seeds. What a mess I had to clean up! The left-over seed was put into a plastic container. So I thought that was the end of that! However, the cockatoo was too clever. I would hide the seed but he kept finding it. Then the lorikeets would want their share. So there were many confrontations between the three birds, with the cockatoo always giving in to the noisy lorikeets.\n\nSome months later I had to stop providing seeds for the birds. One day, when the cockatoo was at the feeder, the lorikeets came in to the feeder too. But this time, the cockatoo stood up to the lorikeets and things quickly became very nasty. The lorikeets soon flew away and once the cockatoo had finished, I took the feeder down. What had once been a lovely social interaction between birds had become a violent attack involving all three.

After hours of early morning field work I returned to a car park in suburbia to be greeted by this – a wild female Lyrebird (note the curved tail that indicates she had been sitting in her nest) yelling at her own reflection on a parked car. Female Lyrebirds are thought to be territorial and this is a lovely demonstration of that. From the birds’ perspective she is communicating with another Lyrebird! It also shows the beauty and complexity of her mimetic repertoire – female Lyrebirds are just as accomplished at mimicry as males. This is the kind of interaction no one would have believed had I not recorded it. This was also in the morning – about 7.30am. I can’t help but think that these “elusive” birds come into suburbia more often than we realise.

It’s Friday, 11am, I wouldn’t expect many people to be at the park or beach, there aren’t. I’m working from home as part of social distancing, I’ve popped down for a quick swim, the sand is warm on my feet as I walk to the water. \n\nI can hear the water lapping as small waves wash ashore and a high-pitched chirping from a bird; I focus on the chirping and I note that it is persistent, shifting between long and short pitched begging. I look at the Silver Gulls (aka seagulls) but I can’t see any begging juveniles – indicated by their brown rather than red legs, mottled brown feathers through the wing and back feathers rather than all grey, brown beak rather than red and black eye rather than white. I look around and see 9 Crested Terns, including the begging juvenile. \n\nCrested Terns and Silver Gulls occur around the entire 25,760 km’s of the Australian coast, yet I suspect we’re all familiar with seagulls but not terns. A likely reason for the differing awareness of these two bird species – that live side-by-side – is that seagulls have adapted to scavenge directly from people and our rubbish. Who hasn’t thrown a chip to the expectant seagulls? Terns shy away from people and continue to forage naturally; I enjoy watching them flying over the water, spotting prey and dive-bombing like a spear into the water to catch a fish. I watched the juvenile Crested Tern beg for a few minutes, another juvenile nearby joined the chorus but neither received food. \n\nI reported the 52 birds of 11 different species I observed using the eBird app, including the observed behaviour of feeding young, so my observation adds to our global understanding of species diversity.",

Invariably through the power of inertia the possums stayed on.\n\nFor a few years the possum house seemed empty until a family of kookaburras took it over as their nest. This was in the last weeks of my partner's life, the Australian anthropologist and eco-philosopher Deborah Bird Rose. On the morning of her funeral the two remaining baby kookaburras finally took flight. One landed under the house, began climbing the stairs to the veranda just as the possum used to do, then successfully flew off. \n\nNow the possums are back in the possum house. Last week my daughter surprised one on the veranda just outside the kitchen door, its head buried in a bag of Bokashi maze, probably not ideal food for possums. I went outside to have a chat and encourage it to return to the bush. When it noticed me it pulled its head out of the plastic bag, looked around and quickly made its way down the stairs—I can only assume, on its way back to the possum house.",

We get dozens of species of birds, from Sulphur-crested Cockatoos to Grey Butcherbirds and Australasian Figbirds. But this year, right before COVID struck and after the bushfires, we had a surprise flock that had never visited before. They live in a wide variety of habitats (with the exception of the more heavily forested regions and drier inland areas) so we knew their appearance wasn’t rare, but our power lines are always dominated by bigger birds or the local troop of native Noisy Miners. \n\nWhen the first rain came after the fires had stopped (the afternoon before the floods began), we were looking outside the window, relieved. A few minutes later, as we looked outside again, we saw nearly 40 Welcome Swallows, lined up on the power lines soaking in the rain. Their age-old role as heralds of spring earned them their name (although some say it’s because sailors out at sea knew that the sight of a swallow meant that land was not far away), so it was interesting to see them welcoming much needed rain. \n\nAt first, they seemed to be frolicking in the rain but as this increased towards the end of the afternoon, they got very restless. They became very agitated and initially seemed to be looking for shelter from the storm on our balcony. The storm escalated quickly and they were being dramatically picked up by the strong winds before they all seemed to perfectly coordinate their landing on our window sill. They stayed there for just under an hour while we rung up a bird expert friend to ask if there was anything we could do to help them, to see if we could quickly set up some kind of shelter on our balcony to help them out. \n\nNight set in and it became hard to see outside, the swallows appeared to have drifted off but the next morning there was clear evidence of their time on our window sill, which remains with us until this day!",

				 "storyFullText": "In January of 2018 my partner and I were holidaying through New Zealand, travelling from the North Island to the South Island over two weeks. On a one night stop over in Greymouth on the west coast of the South Island, we stayed at an Air BnB. The hosts suggested we visit a local tramping route, “Woods Creek Track”, that traversed through a historic gold mine site. The track itself was more beautiful than we expected with lush vegetation, tunnels to explore and a harmonious balance between the historic gold mine relics and the mossy re-growth. The highlight of this walk, however, was the friendship that formed between us and a local. This local Greymouth resident wore a soft, grey coat, stood tall with confidence and rocked his feet to the beat of the bush. He was in fact a South Island Robin, and would have to have been one of the friendliest birds I have ever met. He followed us along most the walk, hopping on the ground and flitting between nearby trees. His behaviour reminded me of the Blue Mountains local, Eastern Yellow Robin, but he was even friendlier. One of the more curious behaviours we observed was when the South Island Robin would place one foot out in front of himself, hover it above the ground, and then very quickly tremble his foot up and down. My partner and I guessed that he may be dislodging bugs from the ground beneath. When we caught onto his hungry intention, we would brush the ground to show the soil beneath and then step back. The curious Robin would hop onto the spot we had just brushed, stomp his foot excitedly and peck at grubs as they arose. This continued for some time until we reached the end of the walk. I have never had such a close interaction with a bird before, which made this walk a truly unforgettable experience. In response, I created an artwork from a photo I took of the bird during the walk and was able to exhibit the artwork, “A Friend from Greymouth (South Island Robin)” in my 2018 Solo Exhibition at MContemporary in Sydney.",

This year was a little different and in fact I spent most of the long weekend inside eating my feelings. Thankfully, I was pulled from my couch for an all-day adventure! An 8 hour kayak adventure was ahead and little did I know what I was in for. Huge swell, sea sickness, sunburn and exhaustion. Oh, and time to appreciate the most amazing bird and marine life that Sydney Harbour surrounds have to offer. The great thing about a kayak, apart from it being a social distancing appropriate activity, is accessibility to remote locations and the ability to activate ‘stealth mode’. On this day, these characteristics offered lowly kayakers the most Oar-inspiring Osprey encounter. In very close proximity, an Osprey had just caught a big fish and perched for lunch.  We sat, floating silently, for more than 10 minutes watching it devour the live fish, head first, totally unfussed by us. It was one of those surreal moments of complete stillness, thinking about the life of an Osprey, and surrendering to the draws of nature in the middle of a huge city.  It completely made my day!

They are unmissable, a bright orange flash poking around every nook and cranny in search of their unfortunate prey. Seeing a spider wasp, members of the family Pompilidae, dragging a paralysed Huntsman spider back to a convenient hole or burrow is a common sight and one that captures the beauty and brutality of nature in one convenient image.\n \nThe biology behind these interactions is pretty straightforward. The wasp paralyses the spider, typically lays a single egg on the spider, buries it, and leaves its larvae to feed on the undead host.\n \nIt’s worth taking the time to watch the trials and tribulations surrounding these interactions when you stumble upon them. This pompilid (spider wasp) I observed spent 30 minutes trying to get her paralysed victim into a convenient spot outside my home. After an admirably tenacious effort to lift the spider into a vent at the side of the house, she threw in the towel. In their inimitable way, ants then went to town on the unfortunate arachnid, dismembering it in short term. As with many ecological interactions in the city, ants came out as the winners.

I look down to find a dark, furry creature with beady black eyes staring up at me. It’s a native swamp rat. It’s wary of me but it doesn’t seem scared; there’s bigger fish to fry. The rat is eyeing off a stem with flowers, a tasty morsel that might be worth grabbing even in the face of a potential predator.\n\nIt doesn’t let me stand in the way. The rat scurries by my feet, reaches up on its hind legs, chomps off the stem, and hurries to safety. Never mind that I am only a metre away, or that there’s a crowd of people nearby. It ventures out again and again looking for more food. I’m stunned.\n\nSwamp rats are diurnal rodents found along Australia’s east coast. They create tunnels through vegetation and feed on sedge and grass stems. This is the first time I've ever seen one. What’s most amazing is that behind me there’s a busy road and a bustling café, but it’s business as usual for this swamp rat.\t \n\nThe Nepean River near Emu Plains is a popular place for walking and it’s busier than ever with the current (COVID) restrictions.

Noon is quieter, but if you’ve got a sharp eye you might spot a sunbathing red-bellied black snake or an eastern water dragon (you might almost step on one!). If you’re looking up, you might be lucky enough to see a soaring white-bellied sea-eagle. People come to the river to exercise but there’s so much to see if you’re paying attention. This place is a treasure.",

Then one day I was on my deck in Cremorne Sydney and noticed a wasp eating a caterpillar that was enjoying the lemon verbena in one of my large (inbuilt) planter boxes. At the time there weren’t any other wasps around, nor any caterpillars. As I watched, over several minutes, I realised it didn’t seem to be eating the caterpillar, but drinking it. The caterpillar gradually shrivelled up. I’m a keen photographer but this photo was taken with my mobile phone.",

I know this as I sit metres away at my table in my bedroom, where you can find me approximately 22 hours a day. 20-odd years to grow, and less than 20 minutes to destroy, the tree has been cut down to make way for a reno, rear access driveway and ‘entertainment area’. It’s a sad day. \n\nIt’s 1.15pm. The Sun arches over the meridian of my street and peeks over the fence. I put my hand to the window and feel the slow heat coming through. I take my coffee outside and wait for the rustling of phantoms amid the Boston ivy that are slowing making their reclamations over the fence. \n\nOne, two – four. The lounge of lizards emerges but seem anything but relaxed. The skittish movement of skinks reflect the anxiety of the day. Unsure whether to run away, or stay and hope they won’t be noticed. The warmth of the sun entices them out as I mourn the loss of the tree, they welcome the light in.",
